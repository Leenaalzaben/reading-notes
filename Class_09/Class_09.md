# 1. Dunder Methods in Python

Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are a set of predefined methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (i.e., dunder).

The purpose of dunder methods is to enable operator overloading, customization of object creation, attribute access, and modification, as well as to define a class's string representation, iteration behavior, and more. By implementing dunder methods.

## Example: `__str__`

One commonly used dunder method is `__str__`, which is used to define a human-readable string representation of an object. When the `str()` function or the `print()` function is called on an object, it internally invokes the `__str__` method of that object.

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person(name={self.name}, age={self.age})"

person = Person("Alice", 25)
print(person)  # Output: Person(name=Alice, age=25)
```

When `print(person)` is called, it internally invokes `person.__str__()`, which returns the formatted string representation of the `Person` object.

Note that there are numerous other dunder methods available, such as `__repr__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__iter__`, `__next__`, and many more. Each dunder method serves a specific purpose and allows you to customize the behavior of your objects in different contexts.

# Ethical Issue in "AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course"

The main ethical issue raised in the video is the misleading nature of the paid course and the potential plagiarism or unauthorized use of developers' work without proper attribution or compensation. The course did not meet the expectations of the students, and the instructor may have used others' work without permission or proper credit.

To avoid such ethical issues:

1. **Research and due diligence**: Thoroughly research the course provider or instructor before enrolling, looking for reviews and feedback from previous students.
2. **Check for attribution and licensing**: Ensure that the course materials provide proper attribution to original authors and adhere to appropriate licensing requirements.
3. **Verify course content and claims**: Evaluate the course content, syllabus, and learning objectives to ensure they align with your expectations and seek recommendations from professionals in the field.
4. **Transparency and honesty**: Look for transparent and honest course materials, avoiding misleading promises and hidden fees.
5. **Reputable sources and certifications**: Choose courses offered by reputable educational institutions, organizations, or platforms with established credibility and consider relevant certifications.
6. **Report unethical practices**: If you encounter unethical practices, such as plagiarism or misleading claims, report them to appropriate authorities or platforms.

# 3. Python `statistics` Module

The Python `statistics` module is a built-in module that provides functions for performing statistical operations.

### Example: `statistics.mean()`

```python
import statistics

data = [4, 6, 2, 8, 5, 2, 8, 9, 3, 5]

mean_value = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean_value)  # Output: 5.2
```

The `statistics` module provides other functions like `median()`, `mode()`, `stdev()`, `variance()`, and more, which enable performing various statistical calculations based on specific requirements.
