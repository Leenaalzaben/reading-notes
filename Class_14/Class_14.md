# The key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries

## Matplotlib

- Various plotting library with a wide range of functions and customization options.
- Low-level library providing fine-grained control over plots.
- Suitable for creating basic to complex static visualizations.
- Example use case: Line chart showing stock prices over time with customized labels and legends.

## Seaborn

- High-level statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
- Provides a concise API for creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
- Well-suited for visualizing complex statistical relationships.
- Example use case: Scatter plot with regression lines showing the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales in different cities.

## Bokeh

- Library for creating interactive visualizations that can be displayed in web browsers.
- Designed for handling large and streaming datasets.
- Supports interactive tools like zooming, panning, and hovering.
- Suitable for creating interactive dashboards and real-time data visualizations.
- Example use case: Interactive line plot with tooltips showing population growth of cities over time, allowing users to explore data points.

## The main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots

## Relational Plots

- Main function: `sns.relplot()`
- Purpose: Visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.
- Use case example: Creating a scatter plot to examine the relationship between car horsepower and fuel efficiency (miles per gallon).

## Categorical Plots

- Main functions: `sns.catplot()`, `sns.boxplot()`
- Purpose: Compare the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories or groups.
- Use case example: Generating a box plot to compare housing prices across different neighborhoods in a city.

## Distribution Plots

- Main functions: `sns.histplot()`, `sns.kdeplot()`, `sns.distplot()`
- Purpose: Visualize the distribution of a single variable.
- Use case example: Creating a histogram to understand the distribution of student exam scores in a class.

## The role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow

Key sections and elements featured in the cheat sheet include:

1. Plotting Functions:
   - Demonstrates various plot types available in Seaborn, with descriptions and visual examples.
   - Helps developers choose the appropriate plot type for their data quickly.

2. Figure Aesthetics:
   - Highlights color palettes, plot themes, and customization options for axes, legends, titles, and grids.
   - Assists developers in selecting suitable aesthetics to enhance the visual appearance of plots.

3. Statistical Estimation:
   - Covers functions for visualizing statistical estimation, such as regression lines, confidence intervals, and distribution fits.
   - Enables developers to incorporate statistical insights into their visualizations easily.

4. Categorical Data:
   - Provides techniques for visualizing and summarizing categorical data, including bar plots, count plots, and categorical scatter plots.
   - Helps developers explore and present categorical relationships effectively.

5. Grids and Multi-plotting:
   - Offers guidance on creating grid-based layouts and multiple plots in a single figure.
   - Assists developers in organizing and comparing multiple visualizations efficiently.
