# Pain and Suffering ...

1. The main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python.

      Include understanding the syntax and logic of the language, applying Python programming concepts to solve problems, and keeping up with the constantly evolving Python system.

2. To overcome these obstacles, there are some strategies we can follow.

1. Start with simple exercises and gradually move towards more complex problems.

2. Joining online forums with Python community, attending local Python meetups, and participating in open-source projects can be great ways to engage with the community and learn from experienced developers. This can provide beginners with a wealth of resources, support, and feedback that can help them overcome the challenges of learning Python.

# Beginners Guide to Big O ...

1. Time complexity,

Important because it helps us understand how the performance of an algorithm will scale as the input size grows,and refers to the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to complete as a function of the input size. It is usually measured in terms of the number of operations an algorithm performs on the input data.

2. Space complexity,

Refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of the input size, it is usually measured in terms of the amount of auxiliary space an algorithm requires, not including the space used by the input data. 

# Names and Values in Python ...

In Python, variables can by different types of data, which can either be mutable or immutable.

Mutable or immutable are assigned the same. 

Assignment is the same for all values.
Aliasing can make it seem different.
Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be changed once they are assigned.

Immutable data types: [ints, floats, strings, tuples].

Mutable data types are those whose values can be changed after they are assigned.

Mutable data types: [lists, sets, dictionaries].
